A private kitchen sink pack designed for playing with friends on multiplayer servers.

This pack attempts to balance performance with content, allowing a wide range of computers to enjoy the pack. It's also designed to work exclusively with a server, with many mods marked to be installed only on either side. As such, you'll be missing many gameplay features by playing singleplayer!

Featured mods consist of classic content mods such as [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric), [Refined Storage](https://modrinth.com/mod/refined-storage), and a plethora of world-generation-related mods. There has also been a focus on not overwhelming the user, keeping with a consistent fundamental that a regular Minecraft player would understand. A few mods focused on "[fun](https://modrinth.com/mod/exposure)" or "[gay](https://modrinth.com/mod/estrogen)" have also been added.

It's also been a priority to keep performance in check. Every mod has been picked out and configured to minimize the impact on your client. Of course, this is still a content-focused mod pack, meaning performance will still take a hit in busy areas. The current iteration is also based on Forge, meaning many great optimization mods are missing or less effective.

### Why?
The idea behind this pack is to create an "eternal server". One that will always exist, despite periods with little to no activity. When the community wants to play Minecraft again, we add a content mod that we can refocus on! Since we've been adding content mods for months now, this wouldn't apply too well to new users of the pack. As such, I don't recommend using this pack unless you're part of the community it's made for.

When players have reached "end-game", and have little motivation to continue playing on the server, the eternity ends, and a reset is made. These resets are typically completely different from the last iteration. Resets, or "seasons," signify the pack's major version number. (`v1`, `v2`, etc.)

I've developed other mod packs that are targeted towards general use, so anyone can get started at any time. These can be found on my [Modrinth profile](https://modrinth.com/user/encode42).

Some third-party mods, shader packs, and more are packaged within the mod pack file. The credits for these projects can be found [in the `credits.md` file](credits.md). This file is included in the pack's export
