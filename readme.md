A private kitchen sink vanilla+ pack designed for playing with friends on multiplayer servers.

This pack attempts to balance performance with content, allowing a wide range of computers to enjoy the pack. It's also designed to work exclusively with a server, with many mods marked to be installed only on either side. As such, you'll be missing many gameplay features by playing singleplayer!

Featured mods consist of classic content mods such as [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric), [Applied Energistics 2](https://modrinth.com/mod/ae2), and [Botania](https://modrinth.com/mod/botania). There has also been a focus on not overwhelming the user, keeping with vanilla Minecraft's world generation and fundamentals. A few mods focused on "[fun](https://modrinth.com/mod/exposure)" or "[gay](https://modrinth.com/mod/estrogen)" have also been added.

It's also been a priority to keep performance in check. Every mod has been picked out and configured to minimize the impact on your client. Of course, this is still a content-focused mod pack, meaning performance will still take a hit in busy areas.

### Why?
The idea behind this pack is to create an "eternal server". One that will always exist, despite periods with little to no activity. When the community wants to play Minecraft again, we add a content mod that we can refocus on! Since we've been adding content mods for months now, this wouldn't apply too well to new users of the pack. As such, I don't recommend using this pack unless you're part of the community it's made for.

I've developed other mod packs that are targeted towards general use, so anyone can get started at any time. These can be found on my [Modrinth profile](https://modrinth.com/user/encode42).

You can still view a server using this pack [here](https://view.encrypted.group)!
